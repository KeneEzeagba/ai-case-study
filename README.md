- The company was founded in 2016 by Clifton Harness and Ryan Griege.

- One of their founders, Clifton Harness, was working at a development company when he got frustrated endlessly drawing apartment units and counting parking stalls. The effort it took to complete these mundane tasks was painstaking. Clifton reached out to his college roommate Ryan Griege who was a software developer and asked if he could build a program to help him do his job faster. That's where the idea for the company came about.

## Recommendations

- If I were to advise the company, I would suggest they offer Zillow or Redfin (or related apps) integrations.

- These products would help the company introduce the functionality of 'Inspired Designing', where developers or architects can pay a subscription fee to access different building designs and take inspiration from them for their projects.

- These services would need technologies like Revit to import TestFit sites and buildings, AutoCAD to use file coordinate systems and units of measurement, SketchUp to generate components from stacked building elements, Zoneomics to visualize land use with color-coded zoning maps, Enscape to create conceptual renderings for presentations, TT Core Studio to automate parking garage structural column placement, and ESRI to stop manually recreating diagrams from other data sources.
